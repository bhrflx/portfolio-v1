**[Live Site](https://usus.org)**<br/>

USUS is a small landscape architecture studio based in Zurich, Switzerland. Their work aims to "find a place between the familiar and the unfamliar" and their new website needed to reflect that. The webdesign, done by <ins>[Pascal Botlik](https://botlik.net/)</ins>, is unconventional, yet intuitive to use. The page is split in two separate sections, which can be switched with a click. The first one shows an ordered list of all projects while the second one features a regularly updated stream of quotes, images or videos, reflecting the nature of USUS' work. Subpages are displayed as Modals, which can be scrolled upwards to dismiss them. A large, yellow button leads to a chatroom for every visitor to share their thoughts in.
Because of the unconventional nature of the design, I needed tools flexible enough to realise all the needed features. I decided to use Next.js as a frontend framework, as its extremely performant and packed with lots of helpful features. As a CMS, I used Sanity.io. It's extremely customisable and features a responsive, React based interface. Additionally, I modified the backend to allow automatic translations of fields using the DeepL API.
