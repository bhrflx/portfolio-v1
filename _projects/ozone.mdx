An Exploration of Rain: We primarily associate rain with unpleasantries. We miss the sunshine and hate getting wet.
In our collective discomfort, we tend to forget the great sides of rain; why we need it and how it can help us in our daily lives.
With OZONE I tried to break with the negative connotation of rain and show ways to understand and enjoy "bad weather".
For that I wrote and designed a "rain compendium" and developed a small VR application for you to roam around a rainy landscape without getting wet.
